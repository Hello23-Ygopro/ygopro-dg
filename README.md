## How to play
1. Start YGOPro.
2. Click on `Deck Edit` to build your deck. Remember to add 1 _Digimon Card Game Rules_!<br>
If you do not build your deck according to the following rules, you will lose the game and have to rebuild your deck:<br>
● Your [deck](https://digimoncardgame.fandom.com/wiki/General_Rules#Decks) must be exactly 50 cards.<br>
● Your [Digi-Egg](https://digimoncardgame.fandom.com/wiki/Card_Types#Digi-Egg) deck cannot have more than 5 cards.
3. Shuffle your deck and Digi-Egg deck, draw 5 cards, and place them face down in your [Security Stack](https://digimoncardgame.fandom.com/wiki/General_Rules#The_Playing_Field) without looking at them. Then, draw 5 cards. This is your starting hand.<br>
4. During your [Unsuspend Phase](https://digimoncardgame.fandom.com/wiki/General_Rules#Game_Flow), unsuspend all of your suspended cards.<br>
5. During your [Draw Phase](https://digimoncardgame.fandom.com/wiki/General_Rules#Game_Flow), draw 1 card. The player who goes first does not draw a card. There is no limit to how many cards you can have in your hand.<br>
6. During your [Breeding Phase](https://digimoncardgame.fandom.com/wiki/General_Rules#Game_Flow), you can do only one of the following once per turn:<br>
● Hatch a Digi-Egg. This can only be done when there are no [Digimon](https://digimoncardgame.fandom.com/wiki/Card_Types#Digimon) in the [Breeding Area](https://digimoncardgame.fandom.com/wiki/General_Rules#The_Playing_Field). Flip one card face up from the top of the Digi-Egg deck and place it in the Breeding Area.<br>
● Move a Digimon out of the Breeding Area to the [Battle Area](https://digimoncardgame.fandom.com/wiki/General_Rules#The_Playing_Field) once they have digivolved into a level 3 or higher Digimon. This is not considered playing the Digimon, so [On Play] effects will not activate. Digimon that are level 2 or lower cannot enter the Battle Area.<br>
● Proceed to the next phase without doing anything.<br>
7. During your [Main Phase](https://digimoncardgame.fandom.com/wiki/General_Rules#Main_Phase), you can perform as many of the following actions as you like, in any order:<br>
	7.1. [Play](https://digimoncardgame.fandom.com/wiki/General_Rules#A._Playing_Digimon) a Digimon card from your hand to your Battle Area unsuspended.<br>
	[Pay](https://digimoncardgame.fandom.com/wiki/General_Rules#Paying_Memory_Costs) the play cost of that Digimon card. The Digimon is now played in the Battle Area. (If a level 2 or lower Digimon enters the Battle Area, it is placed in the [Trash (Recycle Bin)](https://digimoncardgame.fandom.com/wiki/General_Rules#The_Playing_Field) immediately. This is not treated as being deleted.)<br>
	Digimon cannot attack on the turn they were played. (You can only have a maximum of 5 Digimon in YGOPro.)<br>
	7.2. [Digivolve](https://digimoncardgame.fandom.com/wiki/General_Rules#B._Digivolving) a Digimon in your Battle Area or Breeding Area.<br>
	Check the digivolution conditions listed on a card in your hand. If you have a Digimon in play that matches the required color and level, it can digivolve into the Digimon card you have in your hand. If a card has multiple digivolution conditions, a Digimon must only satisfy one of those conditions to digivolve into it.<br>
	Once digivolution is complete, draw 1 card as a digivolution bonus.<br>
	7.3. [Play](https://digimoncardgame.fandom.com/wiki/General_Rules#C._Playing_Tamers) a [Tamer](https://digimoncardgame.fandom.com/wiki/Card_Types#Tamer) card from your hand to your Battle Area unsuspended.<br>
	Pay the play cost of that Tamer card. The Tamer is now played in the Battle Area.<br>
	Tamers cannot attack or block. (You can only have a maximum of 5 Tamers in YGOPro.)<br>
	7.4. [Activate](https://digimoncardgame.fandom.com/wiki/General_Rules#D._Using_Option_Cards) the [Main] effect of an [Option](https://digimoncardgame.fandom.com/wiki/Card_Types#Option) card from your hand. To use an Option card, you must have at least one Digimon or Tamer of the same color as the Option card in your Battle Area or Breeding Area.<br>
	Place the Option card in the field from your hand, pay its cost, then the Option card's [Main] effect is activated.<br>
	After the effect has been activated, the Option card is placed in the Trash.<br>
	Security effects of Option cards cannot be activated from your hand.<br>
	7.5. Your Digimon in the Battle Area can make [attacks](https://digimoncardgame.fandom.com/wiki/General_Rules#E._Attacking).<br>
	Suspend an unsuspended Digimon you want to attack with and declare your attack.<br>
	Choose the target of your attack. You can either target one of your opponent's suspended Digimon in their Battle Area, or the opposing player.<br>
	Any [When Attacking] effects are activated at this point.<br>
	Depending on the attack target, one of the following situations occur:<br>
	● Digimon: The Digimon with the higher DP wins. The defeated Digimon is deleted and gets placed in its owner's Trash.<br>
	If both Digimon have equal DP, the battle is a draw, and both Digimon are deleted.<br>
	(If a Digimon's DP falls to zero, it is deleted and placed in the Trash.<br>
	● Opposing player: If they have at least 1 Security card in their Security Stack, flip over their top Security card. This is called checking.<br>
	If the checked card has a Security effect, that effect is activated.<br>
	If a Digimon card is flipped over, it becomes a Security Digimon, and does battle with the attacking Digimon.<br>
	Security Digimon are not considered regular Digimon, and effects that are effective on regular Digimon cannot be activated against them. Security Digimon can only activate Security effects.<br>
	If the attacking Digimon is defeated, they are deleted, and the attack ends.<br>
	Regardless of the battle's outcome, the Security Digimon is placed in the Trash after the battle ends.<br>
	Option and Tamer cards are placed in the Trash.<br>
8. During your turn, if the memory counter goes to 1 or above on your opponent's side due to costs or other effects, your turn [ends](https://digimoncardgame.fandom.com/wiki/General_Rules#Ending_a_Turn) and it becomes your opponent's turn. (After all effects are resolved, your opponent's turn begins.)

**Important:**
1. This YGOPro game is only compatible with the Microsoft Windows operating system.
2. Online play is not supported.
3. At least 1 player must have _Digimon Card Game Rules_ in their deck, otherwise the mod will not function properly.
4. Enable `Do not check Deck` when creating a game to avoid an error due to a player having 4 copies of a card with the same name in their deck.

## How to win
1. If you attack your opponent when they have zero Security cards remaining.
2. If your opponent cannot draw during their Draw Phase because there are no cards left in their deck.
